# Legendary Octo Fishstick

**Legendary Octo Fishstick** is a boilerplate project built with **Next.js**, **NextAuth.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and various other modern web development tools. It serves as a starting point for applications that need authentication, a clean development environment, and optimized performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication for Next.js applications.
- **React Query**: Data-fetching library that simplifies server-state management.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Day.js**: A minimalist library for date and time manipulation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Yup**: A JavaScript schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 18.x or above)
- npm or yarn (Node package manager)

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/legendary-octo-fishstick.git
cd legendary-octo-fishstick


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
